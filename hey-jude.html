    <h1>Hey Jude</h1>
    <p class="couplet">
       Hey Jude, don't make it bad<br>
       Take a sad song and make it better<br>
       Remember to let her into your heart<br>
       Then you can start to make it better
    </p>
    <p class="couplet">
       Hey Jude, don't be afraid<br>
       You were made to go out and get her<br>
       The minute you let her under your skin<br>
       Then you begin to make it better
    </p>
    <p class="couplet">
       And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain<br>
       Don't carry the world upon your shoulders<br>
       For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool<br>
       By making his world a little colder<br>
       Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
    </p>
    <p class="couplet">
       Hey Jude, don't let me down
       You have found her, now go and get her<br>
       Remember to let her into your heart<br>
       Then you can start to make it better
    </p>
    <p class="couplet">
       So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin<br>
       You're waiting for someone to perform with<br>
       And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do<br>
       The movement you need is on your shoulder<br>
       Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah
    </p>
    <p class="couplet">
       Hey Jude, don't make it bad<br>
       Take a sad song and make it better<br>
       Remember to let her under your skin<br>
       Then you'll begin to make it<br>
       Better better better better better better, oh
    </p>
