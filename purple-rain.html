    <h1>Purple Rain</h1>
    <p class="couplet">
      I never meant 2 cause U any sorrow<br>
      I never meant 2 cause U any pain<br>
      I only wanted one time 2 see U laughing<br>
      I only want 2 see U laughing in the purple rain
    </p>
    <p class="refrain">
      Purple rain Purple rain<br>
      Purple rain Purple rain<br>
      Purple rain Purple rain
    </p>
    <p class="couplet">
      I only want 2 see U bathing in the purple rain

      I never wanted 2 be your weekend lover
      I only wanted 2 be some kind of friend
      Baby I could never steal U from another
      It's such a shame our friendship had 2 end
    </p>

      Purple rain Purple rain
      Purple rain Purple rain
      Purple rain Purple rain
    </p>
    <p class="couplet">
      I only want 2 see U underneath the purple rain

      Honey I know, I know, I know times are changing
      It's time we all reach out for something new
      That means U 2
      U say U want a leader
      But U can't seem to make up your mind
      I think you better close it
      And let me guide U 2 the purple rain
    </p>
    <p class="refrain">
      Purple rain Purple rain
      Purple rain Purple rain
    </p>
    <p class="couplet">
      If you know what I'm singing about up here
      C'mon raise your hand

      Purple rain Purple rain

      I only want 2 see U, only want 2 see U
      In the purple rain
